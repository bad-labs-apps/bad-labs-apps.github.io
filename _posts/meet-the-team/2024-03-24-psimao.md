Greetings ðŸ‘‹

I'm the first and only contributor to **Bad Labs** to date, focoused on exploring what's new in `Android` and `Kotlin` universe, but also curious about `iOS` and `Swift`, and any other platforms or languages required to get an app out in the wild.

Apart from the tech stuffs, I'm passionate about **dogs**, **video game**, **woodworking** and **astronomy**.
